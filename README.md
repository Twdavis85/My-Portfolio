## Description
This week for homework we were asked to create a portfolio website.  This website will display examples of our work to show future employers that we are a good candidate for an open position.

## Installation
* The first thing I did was create a repository named My-Portfolio with Github and clone it
* Next I opened My-Portfolio with VS Code and created index.html and styles.css files as well as making a folder for images
* After that I made an HTML page with the information for my portfolio page
* Once I had the HTML page complete I started making the CSS file to style my page
* With the CSS file I styled flexboxes, set background colors, and changed font size, color, family, etc
* Once I had the boxes and navigation bar where I wanted them I started on animation and linking the navigation bar to take the user to the appropriate section when clicked
* When the animation was complete I added background images to the boxes in the "My Work" section
* When that was done I went through the HTML and CSS pages and tweaked some things to get everything exactly the way I wanted them to look
* Once I had it looking how I wanted I used @media selectors to change the page layout based on screen size to accommodate tablets and cell phones
* After that I linked some of my work to the "My Work" section and added links for my phone number, email, Github and LinkedIn in the "Contact Me" section

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Git Bash
* GitHub
